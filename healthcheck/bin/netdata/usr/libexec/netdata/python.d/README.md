# Disclaimer

Every module should be compatible with python2 and python3.
All third party libraries should be installed system-wide or in `python_modules` directory.
Module configurations are written in YAML and **pyYAML is required**.

Every configuration file must have one of two formats:

- Configuration for only one job:

```yaml
update_every : 2 # update frequency
retries      : 1 # how many failures in update() is tolerated
priority     : 20000 # where it is shown on dashboard

other_var1   : bla  # variables passed to module
other_var2   : alb
```

- Configuration for many jobs (ex. mysql):

```yaml
# module defaults:
update_every : 2
retries      : 1
priority     : 20000

local:  # job name
  update_every : 5 # job update frequency
  other_var1   : some_val # module specific variable

other_job: 
  priority     : 5 # job position on dashboard
  retries      : 20 # job retries
  other_var2   : val # module specific variable
```

`update_every`, `retries`, and `priority` are always optional.

---

The following python.d modules are supported:

# apache

# cpufreq

This module shows the current CPU frequency as set by the cpufreq kernel
module.

**Requirement:**
You need to have `CONFIG_CPU_FREQ` and (optionally) `CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_STAT`
enabled in your kernel.

This module tries to read from one of two possible locations. On
initialization, it tries to read the `time_in_state` files provided by
cpufreq\_stats. If this file does not exist, or doesn't contain valid data, it
falls back to using the more inaccurate `scaling_cur_freq` file (which only
represents the **current** CPU frequency, and doesn't account for any state
changes which happen between updates).

It produces one chart with multiple lines (one line per core).

### configuration

Sample:

```yaml
sys_dir: "/sys/devices"
```

If no configuration is given, module will search for cpufreq files in `/sys/devices` directory.
Directory is also prefixed with `NETDATA_HOST_PREFIX` if specified.

---

# cpuidle

**Requirement:**
Your kernel needs to have `CONFIG_CPU_IDLE` enabled.

each state.

3. **commands** - number of IMAP commands 
 * commands
 
4. **Faults**

It produces one chart with multiple lines (one line per jail)
 
### configuration

Sample:

```yaml
local:
 log_path: '/var/log/fail2ban.log'
 conf_path: '/etc/fail2ban/jail.local'
 exclude: 'dropbear apache'
```
If no configuration is given, module will attempt to read log file at `/var/log/fail2ban.log` and conf file at `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`.

  acct       : False # Freeradius accounting statistics.
  proxy_auth : False # Freeradius proxy authentication statistics. 
  proxy_acct : False # Freeradius proxy accounting statistics.
```

**Freeradius server configuration:**

The configuration for the status server is automatically created in the sites-available directory.
By default, server is enabled and can be queried from every client. 
FreeRADIUS will only respond to status-server messages, if the status-server virtual server has been enabled.

To do this, create a link from the sites-enabled directory to the status file in the sites-available directory:
 * cd sites-enabled
 * ln -s ../sites-available/status status

and restart/reload your FREERADIUS server.

Without configuration, module attempts to connect to `http://localhost:8080/manager/status?XML=true`, without any credentials. 
So it will probably fail.
