This document list the changes and updates between the different Norma versions built for the Nordic ID Smart readers.

Changes in v1.0.3
- AntennaProperties/AntennaConnected now utilized for active ROSpecs => if AISpec antennaID(s) == 0 and new antennas connected/disconnected(AntennaConnected state changed via SET_READER_CONFIG) => internal antenna array updated for running ROSpecs

Changes in v1.0.2
- AISpec AntennaID 0 now utilizing all enabled antennas(check AntennaProperties "connected"-state)
- Add_ROSpec now replaces correctly the previous entry
- KeepAliveSpec now closes the connection if periodic keepalive is used and missed ACKs > 5
- Connection overriding now allowed from "previous" client i.e. same client can reconnect if connection dropped due to network loss or similar. Peridioc keep alive recommended even with this.

Changes in v1.0.1
- Fixes issue where AISpec AntennaID 0 did not use all antennas defined in AntennaProperties which had AntennaConnected set to 1
