This document list the changes and updates between the different Norma versions built for the Nordic ID Smart readers.

Changes in v.1.0.7
- RxSensitivity uses RSSI filter on AR82/AR85/AR62/Sampo S2 if using newer chip. Range is the same as for other chip versions i.e. -70 to -50. Highest sensitivity allowing lower RSSI also.

Changes in v1.0.6
- GetRospecs returns now StatusCode_M_Success also when no ROSpecs available

Changes in v1.0.5
- Removed reporting of all available HopTables since reader is anyway locked to a specific region
- Default reader configuration correctly fills now ROSpec AntennaConfiguration if its only partial(i.e has only RFTransmitter properties but others are absent)

Changes in v1.0.4
- ChannelIndex used from RFTransmitter settings if available
- HoptableIDs changed to match NurApi.Region setting
- ReceiverSensitivity now in DeviceCapabilities, used also from Spec/ReaderConfig when performing Spec
- Added option for reader configuration(in web view) to disable sensors from device i.e. Norma does not list the tap/light sensors from Sampo S1 as one of its GPIOs. 
- GPOPortNumber indexing changed from 5-8 to 1-4. 
- C1G2SingulationControl parameters used properly also when TagInventoryStateAware is 0

Changes in v1.0.3
- AntennaProperties/AntennaConnected now utilized for active ROSpecs => if AISpec antennaID(s) == 0 and new antennas connected/disconnected(AntennaConnected state changed via SET_READER_CONFIG) => internal antenna array updated for running ROSpecs

Changes in v1.0.2
- AISpec AntennaID 0 now utilizing all enabled antennas(check AntennaProperties "connected"-state)
- Add_ROSpec now replaces correctly the previous entry
- KeepAliveSpec now closes the connection if periodic keepalive is used and missed ACKs > 5
- Connection overriding now allowed from "previous" client i.e. same client can reconnect if connection dropped due to network loss or similar. Peridioc keep alive recommended even with this.

Changes in v1.0.1
- Fixes issue where AISpec AntennaID 0 did not use all antennas defined in AntennaProperties which had AntennaConnected set to 1
